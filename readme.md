Red Locomotive
==============

Red locomotive is a pure JavaScript game engine. It has an extensive set of modules for creating thousands of animated
and interactive game elements. Build anything you want. Red Locomotive is not a framework and will not restrict you.
It gives you access to a very useful api that offers everything from a module loader to vector calculating functions.
